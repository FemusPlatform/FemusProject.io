## Welcome to GitHub Pages

FEMuS team is currently working on [NumericPlatform](https://github.com/FemusPlatform/NumericPlatform) project.
This is a numerical platform that has been developed to couple different numerical codes. The aim is to realize
an environment where complex physical phenomena, occurring on several physical scales, can be modeled using 
existing codes. 
Up to now the following codes can be installed 
[FEMuS code](https://github.com/FemusPlatform/femus)
